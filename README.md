## Intro  
  OneBlog is a personal blog developed by **SPM team A8**.    
  We used to use **SpringBoot** and ~~Vue.js~~ to develop. Later we changed to **Bootstrap** to develop the front end. Also we chosed **MySQL**.  

## Feature
  - You can register as a **Blogger** to publish an article, yet you can just browse articles published by other **Blogger** as a **Visitor**.
  - We also have some **Admins** to make sure the articles are legal, so remind don't publish something not good!
  - As a **Visitor**, you can **search** for title of articles, and **archive** them by year.
  - As a **Blogger**, other than **visitor** can do, you can also add **Categories** and **Tags** to your article, and **change** them later.
  - You can set up an **avatar** for your **Blogger** account! If you don't want to, we will choose a **default** one for you.
